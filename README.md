# amFOSS Anveshan 2025
Hello! I am Rahul Krishna R, a first year B.Tech CSE(AI) student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri Campus.
Recently I got selected into amFOSS, one of the most leading FOSS clubs in India!

As part of the amFOSS-Curriculum for freshers, it is compulsary to complete a set of tasks. This repo documents all the details throughout my
