# Design for **MeloFi**

As my WireFrames for MeloFi has been approved by my mentors, 
I managed to transform those WireFrames into high-fidelity designs.

I also made sure that my designs for both mobile and web versions are visually aesthetic and attractive.

In my point of view, it excited me as I am just a beginner in this.

You can view the MeloFi designs for both versions from here:
